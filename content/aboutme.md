I am currently a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, previously I completed my Masters Degree at the same institution. Development of off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods is my central focus and in my space time work on C++ hobby projects (I'm a bit of a template metaprogramming addict). 

My current research group is the [Macromolecular Materials Laboratory](https://www.mml.msm.cam.ac.uk/), previously I was with the [Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre](https://www.rrutc.msm.cam.ac.uk/).

## Hiking

I am an avid ultralight hiker; this is the pursuit of 'thru-hiking' long-distance trails carrying the minimal amount of equipment (usually [less than 3.5kg](https://lighterpack.com/r/5vox2a)) including custom equipment I make myself. I have completed many unsupported multiday expeditions including:

- West Highland Way - 154km
- South Downs Way - 161km
- Pennine Way - 431 
- GR10 - 866km
- GR5 + Tour du Mont Blanc + GR52 - 842km
- Cape Wrath Trail [*abandoned half way*] - 320km 
- Section of the South West Coast Path - 50km
- GR54 + GR549 - 267km
- GR20 - 180km
