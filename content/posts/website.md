After becoming the <del>unwillingly</del> elected member of the [MML](https://www.mml.msm.cam.ac.uk/) to revamp the our website and learning my way around [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)/[GoLang](https://go.dev/)/[PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and static websites in general. I decided it was finally time to put something together for myself. So welcome to my site! 

I intend to use this as a space to display my (professional) achievements and hopefully write some blogs about C++ and scientific-computing.
