In 2020 [my thesis](thesis.pdf), for my Masters in Scientific Computing, was awarded a Distinction by the University of Cambridge. This will form the foundations of my research focus for the next three years.

## Abstract

The project aims to implement an off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo model, based on the dimer
saddle-point finding method, suitable for simulating the interaction of hydrogen with crystal
defects in iron, such as vacancies, grain-boundaries and dislocations, over timescales not
achievable with classical methods including molecular dynamics. The framework is used to
interrogate the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement, causing severe loss in ductility in steels
with complicated microstructures, focusing on hydrogen-vacancy systems.
