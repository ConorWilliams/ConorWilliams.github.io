My slides are available [here](TMS.pdf).

This year I attended the TMS Annual Meeting & Exhibition in San Diego with one of my colleges from the university of Cambridge. 

I presented my work on the development of off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods for simulating the interaction of hydrogen with crystal defects at the _Symposium of Thermodynamics and Kinetics_. The presentation was very successful and lead to deep discussions with experts in the field, including Laurent Karim BÃ©land, one of the authors of the k-ART program.

I also attended a number of talks on the subject of hydrogen embrittlement and the use of machine learning (ML) in materials science. I was particularly impressed by the work of Matthias Rupp on ultra-fast interpretable machine-learning potentials. This is a field I am very interested in and I hope to apply some of these techniques to my own work in the future. I believe that ML will be a key tool in the future of materials science and that some of the techniques developed by the materials community will feed-back into the wider ML community.
