The presentation was very successful and lead to deep discussions with experts in the field, including Laurent Karim Béland, one of the authors of the k-ART program.\nI also attended a number of talks on the subject of hydrogen embrittlement and the use of machine learning (ML) in materials science. I was particularly impressed by the work of Matthias Rupp on ultra-fast interpretable machine-learning potentials. This is a field I am very interested in and I hope to apply some of these techniques to my own work in the future. I believe that ML will be a key tool in the future of materials science and that some of the techniques developed by the materials community will feed-back into the wider ML community.\n","permalink":"//conorwilliams.github.io/posts/tms2023/","summary":"My slides are available here.\nThis year I attended the TMS Annual Meeting \u0026amp; Exhibition in San Diego with one of my colleges from the university of Cambridge.\nI presented my work on the development of off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods for simulating the interaction of hydrogen with crystal defects at the Symposium of Thermodynamics and Kinetics.

Custom schedulers supported. Tasks support allocators. Exceptions support removed. Void tasks no longer require a future. Benchmarks!! Many more tests. Planned for the (near) future:\nMore examples. No per-task coroutine frame allocations. A scheduler that sleeps workers when there is no work based on this paper.

Our method ensures that environments within a norm-based tolerance are classified as equivalent. During OLKMC simulations, our method guarantees to elide the maximum number of redundant saddle-point searches in symmetrically equivalent local-environments. Hence, we are able to study the trapping/detrapping of hydrogen from up to five-vacancy clusters and simultaneously the effect hydrogen has on the diffusivity of these clusters. These processes occur at vastly different timescales at room temperature in body-centred cubic iron. We predict the diffusion pathways of clusters/complexes without a priori assumptions of their mechanisms, not only reproducing previously reported mechanisms but also discovering new ones for larger complexes. We detail the hydrogen-induced changes in the clusters’ diffusion mechanisms and find evidence that, in contrast to mono-vacancies, the introduction of hydrogen to larger clusters can increase their diffusivity. We compare the effective hydrogen diffusivity to Oriani’s classical theory of trapping, finding general agreement and some evidence that hydrogen may not always be in equilibrium with traps, when the traps are mobile. Finally, we compute the trapping atmosphere of meta-stable states surrounding non-point traps, opening new avenues to better understand and predict hydrogen embrittlement in complex alloys.\n","permalink":"//conorwilliams.github.io/publications/","summary":"Accelerating off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to predict hydrogen vacancy-cluster interactions in α-Fe C.J.Williams, E.I.Galindo-Nava We present an enhanced off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (OLKMC) model, based on a new method for tolerant classification of atomistic local-environments that is invariant under Euclidean-transformations and permutations of atoms.
